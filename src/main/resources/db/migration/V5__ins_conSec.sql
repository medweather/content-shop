I''m diggin'' my way to something
I''m diggin'' my way to somethin'' better

('Until it sleeps (Metallica)', 'Where do I take this pain of mine
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There''s things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me, until it sleeps...'),

('One (Metallica)', 'I can''t remember anything
Can''t tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I''m waking up, I cannot see
That there''s not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now...'),

('Nothing else matters (Metallica)', 'So close no matter how far
Couldn''t be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don''t just say
And nothing else matters...'),

('Harvester of sorrow (Metallica)', 'My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I''ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate

I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth...'),

('Master of puppets (Metallica)', 'End of passion play, crumbling away
I''m your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I''m killing yo...'),

Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years...'),

We''re one in the river
And one again after the fall

Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lost ourselves, but we find it all...'),

All the world I''ve seen before me passing by
I''ve got nothing, to gain, to lose
All the world I''ve seen before me passing by'),

('Chop Suey (System Of A Down)', 'Wake up!(Wake up!..)
Grab a brush and put a little (makeup!..),
Hide the scars to fade away the (shakeup!..)

Why''d you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable'),

Was Fashion the reason why they were there?

They disguise it, Hypnotize it
Television made you buy it'),

And it''s mine
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
Should be banned
It''s a day that I can''t stand');
